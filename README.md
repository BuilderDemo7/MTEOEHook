# M.T.E:O.E Hook

It allows you to use some cheats, customize controls and use a W.i.P online multiplayer so you can play with multiple friends.                     

It only works for the Nestl√©/World-Wide version of the game.

# Online Multiplayer
The online multiplayer mod is still W.i.P, to enable it go to the configuration file **MTEOEHook.ini** 
and set **Multiplayer** to 1.              
               
Make sure your friend is in the same map as yours and that he did not select the same monster truck as yours.                      
## Server
You can start a server by simple executing **MTEOEMPServer.exe**, it uses the same configuration file as the client (MTEOEHook.ini)
# Customizing Controls
This feature is pretty buggy and might not make your experience in game not good until it's fixed.                           
Open **MTEOEHook.ini**, set *CustomInput* to 1, you will have the following controls to customize:

- AccelerateKey is the key for accelerating your truck *(Default: Enter, VK: 13)*

- LeftKey is the key for turning your truck to the left *(Default: Left Arrow, VK: 37)*
